# rl-sutton-book

This repository tries to implement all reinforcement learning algorithms and examples from *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

## Setup

Dependencies are specified in `pyproject.toml` and managed using `rye`. You can use package managers such as `uv` or `rye` to install dependencies (e.g., `rye sync`).


## Project Structure
`scripts/` contains codes and notebooks for each algorithm or example. `src/` includes modules, environments, and utilities used across different scripts.
